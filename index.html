      <h1>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so,
      in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h1>

      <p>“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
      transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
      for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
      The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
      the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.<svg width="104" height="102" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M104 102V59.727H84.114c0-5.871.689-11.182 2.068-15.933 1.379-4.75 3.42-9.287 6.125-13.61C95.01 25.86 98.909 22.257 104 19.375V0c-9.758 4.27-17.712 9.874-23.864 16.813-6.151 6.939-10.712 14.545-13.681 22.818C63.485 47.904 62 59.941 62 75.74V102h42zm-62 0V59.727H22.114c0-5.871.689-11.182 2.068-15.933 1.379-4.75 3.42-9.287 6.125-13.61C33.01 25.86 36.909 22.257 42 19.375V0c-9.652 4.27-17.58 9.874-23.784 16.813C12.01 23.752 7.424 31.358 4.455 39.631 1.485 47.904 0 59.941 0 75.74V102h42z" fill="#A775F1" fill-rule="nonzero"/></svg> ”</p>

      <p style="color:hsl(219, 29%, 14%); " >“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
      professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
      student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
      did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
      project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
      could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
      experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
      100% recommend! ”</p>

      <h1>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and
      learning from their experiences was easy.</h1>

      <p>"The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program
      gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
      junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from
      an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</p>
